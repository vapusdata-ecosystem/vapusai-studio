To attach a Kubernetes (K8s) cluster as a self-hosted runner for GitHub Actions, you need to set up the GitHub Actions runner in your K8s cluster. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to achieve this:

Step-by-Step Guide
Prepare Your Kubernetes Cluster:

Ensure you have a Kubernetes cluster up and running.
You should have kubectl configured to interact with your cluster.
Create a Namespace:
Create a namespace for the GitHub runner.

sh
Copy code
kubectl create namespace github-runner
Create a Service Account:
Create a service account and necessary roles for the GitHub runner.

sh
Copy code
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: github-runner
  namespace: github-runner
EOF
Download the GitHub Runner:
Download the GitHub Actions runner binary.

sh
Copy code
mkdir actions-runner && cd actions-runner
curl -o actions-runner-linux-x64-2.284.0.tar.gz -L https://github.com/actions/runner/releases/download/v2.284.0/actions-runner-linux-x64-2.284.0.tar.gz
tar xzf ./actions-runner-linux-x64-2.284.0.tar.gz
Create a Kubernetes Deployment:
Create a Kubernetes deployment to run the GitHub Actions runner.

yaml
Copy code
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: github-runner
  namespace: github-runner
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: github-runner
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: github-runner
    spec:
      serviceAccountName: github-runner
      workers:
        - name: runner
          image: myrunnerimage:latest
          env:
            - name: RUNNER_NAME
              value: "github-runner"
            - name: RUNNER_REPOSITORY_URL
              value: "https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository"
            - name: RUNNER_TOKEN
              valueFrom:
                secretKeyRef:
                  name: runner-secret
                  key: runner-token
Create a Secret for the Runner Token:
Create a secret to store your GitHub runner token.

sh
Copy code
kubectl create secret generic runner-secret --from-literal=runner-token=YOUR_RUNNER_TOKEN -n github-runner
Apply the Deployment:
Apply the deployment to your Kubernetes cluster.

sh
Copy code
kubectl apply -f github-runner-deployment.yaml
Verify the Deployment:
Check the status of your deployment to ensure the runner is up and running.

sh
Copy code
kubectl get pods -n github-runner

By following these steps, you can attach a Kubernetes cluster as a self-hosted runner for GitHub Actions, allowing you to run your CI/CD workflows directly within your K8s cluster.


where this binary will be used - Download the GitHub Runner: ?
ChatGPT
The binary downloaded for the GitHub Actions runner (e.g., actions-runner-linux-x64-2.284.0.tar.gz) will be used to set up a self-hosted runner. This runner will execute GitHub Actions workflows within your own infrastructure, such as a Kubernetes cluster.

Steps to Use the Downloaded Binary in Kubernetes
Prepare the Runner Image:

You need to create a Docker image that includes the GitHub runner binary. Here’s an example Dockerfile:
Dockerfile
Copy code
FROM ubuntu:20.04

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl jq

WORKDIR /actions-runner

COPY actions-runner-linux-x64-2.284.0.tar.gz .

RUN tar xzf ./actions-runner-linux-x64-2.284.0.tar.gz

RUN ./bin/installdependencies.sh

COPY entrypoint.sh .

ENTRYPOINT ["/actions-runner/entrypoint.sh"]
Create an Entrypoint Script:

This script will configure and start the runner.
sh
Copy code
#!/bin/bash
RUNNER_ALLOW_RUNASROOT=1 ./config.sh --url ${RUNNER_REPOSITORY_URL} --token ${RUNNER_TOKEN} --name ${RUNNER_NAME} --work _work --unattended --replace
./run.sh
Build and Push the Docker Image:

Build the Docker image and push it to a worker registry.
sh
Copy code
docker build -t myrunnerimage:latest .
docker push myrunnerimage:latest
Create the Kubernetes Deployment:

Define the Kubernetes deployment that uses the custom Docker image with the GitHub runner.
yaml
Copy code
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: github-runner
  namespace: github-runner
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: github-runner
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: github-runner
    spec:
      serviceAccountName: github-runner
      workers:
        - name: runner
          image: myrunnerimage:latest
          env:
            - name: RUNNER_NAME
              value: "github-runner"
            - name: RUNNER_REPOSITORY_URL
              value: "https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository"
            - name: RUNNER_TOKEN
              valueFrom:
                secretKeyRef:
                  name: runner-secret
                  key: runner-token
Create the Secret for the Runner Token:

Store the GitHub runner token in a Kubernetes secret.
sh
Copy code
kubectl create secret generic runner-secret --from-literal=runner-token=YOUR_RUNNER_TOKEN -n github-runner
Apply the Deployment:

Deploy the GitHub runner to your Kubernetes cluster.
sh
Copy code
kubectl apply -f github-runner-deployment.yaml
Explanation
Dockerfile: Prepares a Docker image with the GitHub runner binary and dependencies.
Entrypoint Script: Configures and starts the runner when the worker starts.
Kubernetes Deployment: Defines the deployment that runs the GitHub runner in your Kubernetes cluster.
Secret: Stores the GitHub token securely in Kubernetes.
By following these steps, the downloaded GitHub runner binary is incorporated into a Docker image, which is then used in a Kubernetes deployment to set up a self-hosted runner. This runner can execute GitHub Actions workflows within the Kubernetes environment.
